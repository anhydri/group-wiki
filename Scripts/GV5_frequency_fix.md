# Fix for viewing Gaussian 16 frequency output using Gaussview 5

Might see this error: `ConnectionGLOG::Parse_Gauss_Coord(). Failure reading
oriented atomic coordinates. Line Number...`

The workaround can be found
[here](https://github.com/joaquinbarroso/GaussianEditing/blob/master/Fg16TOgv5).
Also placed in raijin group bin (/short/k96/apps/bin). Alternatively, view the
output of the frequency calculation using molden.
