# Automating workflows

## [QCP](https://github.com/tommason14/qcp) - Quantum Chemical Processor
Automate processes such as 
- creating input and job files
- recursive parsing of log files
- recursive submission of jobs, deletion of queued jobs
- Finding bond distances of xyz files

Currently installed on Raijin, Magnus, Monarch, Massive and Stampede. Implemented for GAMESS, PSI4 and Gaussian calculations

## [LAMMPS input file generation](PHMD)

Scripts to generate a LAMMPS input file, along with a data file containing the
appropriate force field parameters, given an xyz file with numbered atoms. Uses
a python script to fill a blank data file generated by vmd, with a dictionary
populated with the required force field parameters. See the readme in the
folder for more details.

# Visualising results

## [view_hessian_calculation.ipynb](view_hessian_calculation.ipynb) 

Takes a GAMESS log file as an input and produces an infrared spectra along with
a molecule viewer to view all the vibrational modes of files generated using
the FMO approach.

## [gamess_to_molden.py](gamess_to_molden.py)

Parse GAMESS log files for use with
[molden](http://cheminf.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/), allowing for easy viewing of
geometries, convergence, frequencies and vibrational modes generated using the
FMO approach (also works with non-FMO).

Useful when generating IR spectra as molden automatically fits Lorentzian
curves to the intensities found from the Hessian.

Run as `gamess_to_molden.py input.log`

# System admin

Use [folder_sizes.py](folder_sizes.py) to obtain the sizes of each folder in
the current directory.  Useful for logging scratch space usage. (May throw
errors if directory names contain spaces)

# Incompatibilities between software and calculation output

Gaussview 5 cannot read a Gaussian 16 frequency output. A fix is described
[here](GV5_frequency_fix).
